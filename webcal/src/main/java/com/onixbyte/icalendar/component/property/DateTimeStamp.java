/**
 * In the case of an {@link com.onixbyte.icalendar.component.Calendar iCalendar} object that specifies a "{@link
 * Method Method}" property, this property specifies the date and time that
 * the instance of the {@link com.onixbyte.icalendar.component.Calendar iCalendar} object was created. In the case of
 * an {@link com.onixbyte.icalendar.component.Calendar iCalendar} object that doesn't specify a "{@link
 * Method Method}" property, this property specifies the date and time that
 * the information associated with the calendar component was last revised in the calendar store.
 * <p>
 * The value MUST be specified in the UTC time format.
 * <p>
 * This property is also useful to protocols such as [2447bis] that have inherent latency issues with the delivery of
 * content. This property will assist in the proper sequencing of messages containing {@link
 * com.onixbyte.icalendar.component.Calendar iCalendar} objects.
 * <p>
 * In the case of an {@link com.onixbyte.icalendar.component.Calendar iCalendar} object that specifies a "{@link
 * Method Method}" property, this property differs from the "{@link
 * DateTimeCreated CREATED}" and "{@link LastModified LAST-MODIFIED}" properties. These two properties are used to
 * specify when the particular calendar data in the calendar store was created and last modified. This is different
 * from when the {@link com.onixbyte.icalendar.component.Calendar iCalendar} object representation of the calendar
 * service information was created or last modified.
 * <p>
 * In the case of an {@link com.onixbyte.icalendar.component.Calendar iCalendar} object that specifies a "{@link
 * Method METHOD}" property, this property is equivalent to the "{@link
 * LastModified LAST-MODIFIED}" property.
