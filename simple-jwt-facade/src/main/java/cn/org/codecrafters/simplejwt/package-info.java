/**
 * The {@code cn.org.codecrafters.simplejwt} package is the core package of the
 * Simple JWT project, which provides a lightweight and easy-to-use library for
 * working with JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) in Java applications. JWT is a
 * widely-used standard for representing claims between two parties, typically
 * used to secure web and mobile applications. This library aims to simplify
 * the JWT handling process and provide convenient abstractions for JWT
 * generation, validation, and extraction.
 * <p>
 * The Simple JWT library is designed to be flexible and customizable, allowing
 * developers to use different algorithms, token resolvers, and token payload
 * classes based on their specific application requirements. It aims to
 * simplify the JWT handling process while maintaining security and best
 * practices for working with JWTs.
 * <p>
 * Developers should refer to the official documentation and examples for the
 * Simple JWT project to understand how to use the library effectively and
 * securely in their Java applications.
 *

 * @since 1.0.0
