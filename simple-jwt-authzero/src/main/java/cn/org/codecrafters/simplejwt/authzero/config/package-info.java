/**
 * <p>
 * The package {@code cn.org.codecrafters.simplejwt.authzero.config} contains
 * configuration classes related to the {@link
 * cn.org.codecrafters.simplejwt.authzero.AuthzeroTokenResolver}
 * implementation.
 *
 * <p>
 * The classes in this package provide configuration options and settings for
 * the {@link cn.org.codecrafters.simplejwt.authzero.AuthzeroTokenResolver},
 * which is used for resolving JSON Web Tokens (JWT) using the Auth0 library.
 *
 * <p>
 * The {@link
 * cn.org.codecrafters.simplejwt.authzero.config.AuthzeroTokenResolverConfig}
 * class is a configuration class that defines the mapping between standard
 * {@link cn.org.codecrafters.simplejwt.constants.TokenAlgorithm} and the
 * corresponding function implementation used by {@link
 * cn.org.codecrafters.simplejwt.authzero.AuthzeroTokenResolver} for handling
 * JWT algorithms. It enables developers to specify and customize the
 * algorithm functions according to the chosen JWT algorithm and the library
 * being used.
 *
 * <p>
 * The configuration options in this package help developers integrate and
 * configure the {@link
 * cn.org.codecrafters.simplejwt.authzero.AuthzeroTokenResolver} seamlessly
 * into their Spring Boot applications. Developers can fine-tune the token
 * resolution process and customize algorithm handling to align with their
 * specific requirements and desired level of security.
 *
 * <p>
 * It is recommended to explore the classes in this package to understand how
 * to configure and use the {@link
 * cn.org.codecrafters.simplejwt.authzero.AuthzeroTokenResolver} effectively
 * in the Spring Boot environment to handle JWT authentication and
 * authorization securely and efficiently.
