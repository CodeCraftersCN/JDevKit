/**
 * The TimingException class represents an exception that is thrown when there
 * is an error related to time sequence.
 * <p>
 * This class extends the RuntimeException class, which means that instances of
 * TimingException do not need to be declared in a method or constructor's
 * throws clause.
 * <p>
 * Instances of TimingException can be created with or without a message and a
 * cause. The message provides a description of the exception, while the cause
 * represents the underlying cause of the exception and provides additional
 * information about the error.
 * <p>
 * TimingException is typically used to handle exceptions related to timing,
 * such as timeouts or synchronization issues. It is a subclass of
 * RuntimeException, which means it is an unchecked exception and does not need
 * to be caught or declared.
