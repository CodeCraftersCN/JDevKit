/**
 * This package contains classes related to the integration of the {@code
 * io.jsonwebtoken:jjwt-api} library in the Simple JWT project. {@code
 * io.jsonwebtoken:jjwt-api} is a powerful and widely-used Identity as a Service
 * (IDaaS) platform that provides secure authentication and authorization
 * solutions for web and mobile applications. The classes in this package
 * provide the necessary functionality to handle JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) using
 * the {@code io.jsonwebtoken:jjwt-api} library.
 *
 * <p>
 * The main class in this package is the {@link
 * cn.org.codecrafters.simplejwt.jjwt.JjwtTokenResolver}, which
 * implements the {@link cn.org.codecrafters.simplejwt.TokenResolver} interface
 * and uses the {@code io.jsonwebtoken:jjwt-api} library to handle JWT
 * operations. It provides the functionality to create, validate, and extract
 * JWTs using the {@code io.jsonwebtoken:jjwt-api} library. Developers can use
 * this class as the main token resolver in the Simple JWT project when
 * integrating {@code io.jsonwebtoken:jjwt-api} as the JWT management library.
 *
 * <p>
 * The {@code AuthzeroTokenResolver} relies on the {@code
 * io.jsonwebtoken:jjwt-api} library to handle the underlying JWT operations,
 * including token creation, validation, and extraction. It utilizes the {@code
 * io.jsonwebtoken:jjwt-api} {@code Algorithm} class to define and use
 * different algorithms for JWT signing and verification.
 *
 * <p>
 * To use the {@code AuthzeroTokenResolver}, developers must provide the
 * necessary configurations and dependencies, such as the {@code GuidCreator}
 * for generating unique JWT IDs (JTI), the supported algorithm function, the
 * issuer name, and the secret key used for token signing and validation. The
 * {@code AuthzeroTokenResolverConfig} class provides a convenient way to
 * configure these dependencies.
 *
 * <p>
 * Developers using the {@code io.jsonwebtoken:jjwt-api} integration should be
 * familiar with the concepts and usage of the {@code io.jsonwebtoken:jjwt-api}
 * library and follow the official {@code io.jsonwebtoken:jjwt-api}
 * documentation for best practices and security considerations.
 *
 * @since 1.0.0
